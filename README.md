# CAMO
CAMO - A Context-aware Movie Ontology, presents a movie ontology which was build up using contextual features extracted from Linked Open Data (LOD) and movie databases (Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB). The current version of CAMO contains only user context and item context representing data. Item context can be further categorized as representational context and interactional context. The representational context of a movie includes cast and crew, rating, certification, and genre that are retrieved from Rotten Tomatoes, IMDB and LOD.
On the other hand, interactional context represents the opinion components that expressed by the movie viewers in their reviews
.
